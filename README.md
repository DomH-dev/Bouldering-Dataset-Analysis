# Global Bouldering Grades Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores and visualizes bouldering grades across various countries to identify trends and outliers in climbing difficulty. Through rigorous statistical analysis, this project aims to provide insights into how climbing grades vary internationally and discuss potential factors influencing these differences.

## Data Source
The dataset includes bouldering grades collected from several countries, detailing the level of difficulty for different climbs.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jordizar/climb-dataset<br>
Unfortunately the original dataset this one is based off of is no longer available at the time I found out about it.

## Key Findings
- There is significant variability in climbing grades across countries, with some nations showing higher average grades.
- Outliers in the data suggest unique climbing profiles for certain countries.
- Larger sample sizes in some countries allow for more robust conclusions regarding climbing grades and skill levels.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
